# Hell's Gate
A WIP clinet whose purpose is to crawl over a large amount of proxy servers and figure out the best possible combination between them.

## Compiling
### Linux
Just run `make` and the program will be compiled. Alternatively, you can use a compiler of your choice and run the resulted binary file.

## TODO
- [ ] Fix the interface
- [ ] Code the proxy test algorythm
- [ ] Run headless or provide any kind of API
